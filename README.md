# planner_zsh

## Creator

## First Initial Release Date
June 18, 2025
Worked on and off since March 2025. This version took about 3 focused coding sessions (18â€“24 hours total).

## Description
A daily offline planner based on user's system, coded in zsh for macOS but should work with bash shell too.

## Features
1. Show my profile (name, occupation, date of birth)
2. Show to-do list
3. Edit tasks in to-do list

> Note: Profile editing must be done manually for now. Progress isn't tracked yet, and task completion is handled by deleting them through the "Edit Tasks" option.

## How to Use
1. Download `planner_zsh.sh`
2. Place it in your `$HOME` directory or leave as-is (the script automatically sets its base directory depending on your system)
3. Give it permission to run using `Terminal`:
   `bash chmod u+x planner_zsh.sh`
4. Then run it:
   `bash ./planner_zsh.sh`

## Final Acknowledgement
Thank you to my UNIX scripting professor for teaching me bash so well.
